# ESP32 Rust Project

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a basic setup using Rust for an ESP32 microcontroller with WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. The project utilizes Ubuntu WSL for development and flashing onto the ESP32 board.

## Project Details

### Language

- Rust

### Tools

- Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- Ubuntu WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### Board

- ESP32 with WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities

## Prerequisites

### Rust Toolchain

Make sure Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system) are installed. If not, you can install Rust via rustup. Follow the instructions on [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
